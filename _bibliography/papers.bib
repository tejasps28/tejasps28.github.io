    abstract={
        SparseLoc is a global localization framework for city-scale scenarios that leverages vision-language foundation models to generate sparse semantic topometric maps in a zero-shot manner.
        It combines this map representation with a Monte Carlo localization scheme enhanced by a novel late optimization strategy, ensuring improved pose estimation.
        By constructing compact yet highly discriminative maps and refining localization through a carefully designed optimization schedule, SparseLoc overcomes the limitations of existing topometric localization methods, offering a better solution for global localization at the scale of a city.
        Our system achieves over a 5× improvement in localization accuracy compared to existing sparse mapping techniques.
        Despite utilizing only 1/500th of the points of dense mapping methods, it achieves comparable performance, maintaining an average global localization error below 5m and 2° on KITTI Sequences.
