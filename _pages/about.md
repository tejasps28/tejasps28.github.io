<!-- I'm an Engineer and a Researcher in the field of **Robotics**. I am currently working as a Research Assistant at the Robotics Research Centre, IIIT Hyderabad under the guidance of [Prof. Madhava Krishna](https://robotics.iiit.ac.in/faculty_mkrishna/), where I am working on leveraging **Vision-Language Models** for Autonomous Driving.

Prior to this, I was working as a Research Engineer with over 2 years of professional experience, at [Novus Hi-tech Robotic Systemz Ltd](https://novushitech.com/). My main areas of interest are Robotics and Artificial Intelligence(AI) with sub-domains in ***3D Computer Vision, use of Vision for Navigation, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)*** but I'm highly inquisitive to explore different fields as I move forward.
    
I have honed my skills in a variety of domains within Robotics, with notable projects that include creating Digital Twins in Unity 3D, motion planning for cobot applications, leveraging computer vision for obstacle detection, and pioneering in multifloor navigation and sensor fusion for enhanced odometry.

Holding a Bachelor of Technology from [Manipal Institute of Technology](https://www.manipal.edu/mit/program-list/btech/btech-electronics-instrumentation-engineering.html), in Instrumentation and Control Engineering with a minor specialization in Sensor Technology, where I took up subjects like *Advanced Sensor Technology*, *Multi-sensor Data Fusion, Control Theory, and Introduction to Robotics*. In my academic and professional journey, I developed various personal projects that has been pivotal in developing a strong foundation in C++, Python, ROS, Docker, and Sensor integration. Please head to **Projects** section for details.
You can also checkout my github for ROS1 related projects [here](https://github.com/tejasps28/Projects/tree/main) and ROS2 related projects [here](https://github.com/tejasps28/ROS2-Projects).
I am driven by the challenge of solving complex problems and am committed to reducing human intervention in hazardous tasks through the development of innovative robotics solutions. My approach is characterized by a collaborative mindset and an openness to new ideas, which, combined with my technical skills and a keen interest in the latest developments in Robotics and Computer Vision, positions me to contribute significantly to research and development efforts aimed at building robust solutions that benefit mankind.

My unique blend of skills and passion for pushing the boundaries of what's possible in Robotics distinguish me in this rapidly evolving field. To showcase this, view my project [Gantry Robotic Arm for Car Painting application](https://tejasps28.github.io/projects) under the mentorship of [Mr. Lentin Joseph](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lentinjoseph/) 

My hobbies include reading, playing sports and listening to music. I am also interested in travelling and am bit of a foodie. :yum:
