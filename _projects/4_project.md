e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC) is a unique annual competition launched in the month of August every year for undergraduate students in science and engineering colleges, polytechnic. Selected teams are given a robotic kit complete with accessories and video tutorials to help them learn basic concepts in embedded systems and microcontroller programming. Abstracts of real world problems assigned as "themes" are then implemented by the teams using the robotic kits.

The objective of the project was to control a drone, incorporating obstacle avoidance and path planning algorithms to deliver parcels between locations.

The simulation was done using ROS and Gazebo, with image processing techniques applied to detect QR codes and identify landing spots. I contributed to developing the logic for obstacle avoidance and path planning, while PID control was used to fine-tune the drone's movements.

The project successfully placed us in the Top 20 out of 250 teams after completing all the tasks. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/155t5WeAgi_ifMpTaBrr9l9R-mq6nKMdY/view?usp=drive_link"> Certificate here.</a>
